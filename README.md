<h2><i>A brief summary of me</i></h2> 
<p>My journey in the world of programming began during my high school when I had my first encounter with microcontroller programming and the creation of a line-following robot with Arduino.</p>

<p>I enrolled in a college program in analysis and systems development, and in the very first semester, I was part of an artificial intelligence team at the innovation labs. There, I could apply my Arduino knowledge and learn a bit about command-line operations. </p>

<p> My first internship in the technology field gave me hands-on experience in working with a team on projects using Agile methodology, with Azure DevOps boards as the primary stack. </p>

<br>
<h2><i>My current challenge is...</i></h2> 
<p>I thrive to explore the world of game development and continually improve my programming skills.</p>
<p></p>

<h2><i>~ Whenever I'm coding, it feels like I'm flowing ~</i></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Flow is a state of profound concentration that doesn't require effort, simultaneously inducing feelings of relaxation, curiosity, and enchantment. In this state, it's common to lose track of time because the concentration is so intense that the mind doesn't tire; it keeps flowing (hence the name). To reach this state, the task needs to be interesting, fun, and somewhat challenging.</p>
